# Random or not so random?
 
Description: This project is aim to implement optimization algorithm related to randomization. The code is specifically focused on incremented gradient descent (IGD) and includes three implementation that compares the method of ordering with randomization and without. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening "main.ipynb" using jupyter notebook.


## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor and formula referencing from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4184.pdf.
